## Friday Night Practice

### Warm-up/Stretch (5 min)
 * Jog to the fence and back
 * Rows of 3 extending back (I will set up cones where they stand) teach a few stretches

### Ball toss to themselves/Work on catching (5 min)
 * Spread out, toss ball up and catch with glove hand (Challenge themselves with height)

### Catch with teammate (8 min)
 * Spread kids out as far apart as we can
 * Choose teammate with similar skills

(The above stations will stay the same during the season)

### Stations
We will have 3 even groups with similar skilled kids - these drills will change every practice

#### Fielding Drills (Group #1) 10 min (Coach Davis)
 * Mechanics of fielding
   * Athletic stance
   * Knees bent
   * Glove hand in front away from body and on the ground
 * Close range grounders with feet stationary

#### Throwing Drills (Group #2) 10 min (Coach Jason)
 * Mechanics of throwing (No partner-rotate body at the waist, glove arm up towards the target/bent at the elbow, ball arm up extended back with palm facing back. Throw the ball to target while thrusting glove arm down and back toward glove side of the body. (5 balls each way)
   * 2 Knees
   * 1 knee down (glove side)
   * Standing (athletic stance, No step)
   * Standing with lead foot towards target (No step-only weights transfer)
   * Step and throw
 * Each of these drills, the player will throw to a target (Concentrate on form and accuracy)

#### Hitting drills (Group #3) 10 min (Coach Justin)
  * Mechanics of hitting
    * Athletic stance, bat position, both elbow positions, head position (No tilt and seeing the ball with both eyes) I am not a fan of having players step while hitting off the tee. Stepping is a timing thing and causes the player’s eyes to bounce at or right before contact, which leads to poor hitting. At this age, we need to eliminate as much movement as possible.
    * Tee work (have players concentrate on a spot and never take eyes off until the ball is hit) make sure lead foot is even with the post on the tee. I will have spray paint to mark whatever we need to mark.

### Skill competition (if we don’t run out of time)
 * Throwing accuracy (Hit net)
 * Fielding with throw (1 grounder with accurate throw to net)
 * Hitting Tee (1 swing for distance, with proper mechanics)

```
NOTE: Coach Ford will float to each station and assist with what is needed
```

Let’s make these drills as fun as possible! 5 pushups for misbehaving or run to fence and back. Remember, these players do not know much about baseball. We need to tell them small things like where each base is, what a single/double/triple/homerun means, how many outs in an inning and all other situations we come across.

## Sunday Practice

Sundays we will use the machine with players in positions. Encourage the players to throw to bases. Last hit, the player will run it out. If the ball goes past the infield remind them to run to second.

We will use this practice model for all practices unless we scrimmage. The warmups and throwing will remain the same, even on game day.

## Game Day Warmups/Practice
 * Warmups
 * Wiffle ball hitting stations
   * 2 stations with coaches throwing to players-players shag

```
Everything is subject to change, and I encourage your input to make practice more efficient.
